# Traveling-Salesman-Viz
Visualization of the tsp using genetic and particle swarm algorithm. (formerly used nearest neighbor)</br>

# How to run
By clicking, you will create a new point and by hitting space the algorithm will start to work and visualize the solution</br>
Hit space again to optimize the solution

- Space: Run the particle swarm algorithm
- Ctrl+Space: Run the genetic algorithm
